... will be provided in time; come back soon! :)


The ICKEPS organizers provided the file [ICKEPS-info.md](./ICKEPS-info.md) with important information. Please check it out!

# Running the Tutorials
The tutorials are provided in the form of Jupyter notebooks, suitable for running online via Google Colab. Basic knowledge of Python and PDDL is required.
All necessary installations are performed when running the first few cells of each notebook.
The notebooks can be found here:
https://github.com/CLAIR-LAB-TECHNION/ICAPS-24/tree/main/notebooks
At the beginning of each notebook, there is a link to run it on Colab.

If you would like to run the notebooks locally on your machine, you can download them, but some installations may be required (e.g., numpy).
