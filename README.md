# Running the Tutorials
The tutorials are provided in the form of Jupyter notebooks, suitable for running online via Google Colab. Basic knowledge of Python and PDDL is required.
All necessary installations are performed when running the first few cells of each notebook.
The notebooks can be found here:

If you would like to run the notebooks locally on your machine, you can download them, but some installations may be required (e.g., numpy).
Otherwise, just click on "Open in Colab" at the top of each notebook.
